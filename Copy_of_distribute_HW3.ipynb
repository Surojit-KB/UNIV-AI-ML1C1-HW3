At first, only this sample is positive. Then, we take the sample with the next highest score, and call it positive. As we go down the list, we go down a threshold in score or probability. \n",

        "As we keep going down the list, decreasing the threshold, more and more samples become positive, and at first, the true positives rise faster than the false positives. Once past a certain point, false positives increase faster than true positives. Now, if you want a balanced classifier, you look at this turn-around point. But if you want a classifier which penalizes false positives and false negatives differently, the point you want is different.\n",

        "A rote reading of the ROC curve (go to the \"northwest\" corner) is a bad idea: you must fold in the curve with any assumptions you are making about the utilities. In our case we have both an asymmetric data set, and asymmetric risk, so the north west corner may not be the right spot. Still, on the whole, a curve with a greater AUC (area under curve), or further away from the line of randomness, will give us a rough idea of what might be a better classifier."

        "Just like in a ROC curve, we go down the sorted (by score or probability) list of samples. We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. In addition to what we do for the ROC curve, we now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the most positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n"
